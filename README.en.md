## How to develop
**BN and bn below refer to BlocklyNukkit**
### Use graphical editor to develop
One of the biggest features of BlocklyNukkit is that it provides a simple, fast and efficient graphical editor for people without any programming experience or foundation. Using the graphical editor, you can quickly drag and drop puzzles similar to scratch. A simple plug-in is implemented, and it can be directly packaged into a jar and released.

## For bn plugin developers

## bn Developer Qia Fan Raiders

### 1. Take customized orders
In the major nukkit server groups, there are many server owners who will publish customized plug-in requirements. You can make money by taking orders. If you want to take orders, modify your group business card or private chat to publish customized requirements. Very good way.
Under normal circumstances, starting with a custom order of 50, it is a little harder to be 100+RMB, and you can at least earn the electricity bill for writing plug-ins every day.

### 2. Sell emeralds at mcbbs
The mcbbs forum has a developer reward mechanism. Regardless of whether your plug-in is used or not, as long as you make and publish it, you can apply for the virtual currency of emerald as a reward.
There are many emerald merchants in mcbbs who specialize in purchasing emeralds. The purchase here actually refers to purchasing for others. Basically, the price of emeralds is maintained at 40 RMB/piece, and each purchase will only purchase 12/17/24 pieces. , There will be 1-3 emeralds for every ordinary plug-in released, 8 if you make it carefully, and 15 or so if you continue to update it, which is equivalent to 600RMB, which is relatively stable and has a considerable income. Way.

### 3. Selling diamonds at minebbs
The developer reward mechanism of minebbs forum is diamonds. You can get diamonds by applying for the essence plug-ins, and the threshold is much lower than that of mcbbs. Almost all plug-ins can get diamonds. The good plug-ins can get 15 or so, and the general small plug-ins are 2 , 3 such.
Because minebbs has a transfer mechanism, it is more convenient to sell diamonds to merchants who collect diamonds. Each diamond is about 8RMB, and 1 can be sold. It is a good place for novices.

### 4. Participate in the blocklynukkit development competition
bn will regularly hold development competitions in minebbs. Winners will receive cash rewards ranging from tens of dollars and rich diamond rewards. If you participate in a competition and do it with your heart, it’s okay to make a few tens of dollars.


## How to make your plugin easier to get high emerald/diamond rewards

### 1. Typesetting your posts carefully
As we all know, it is very important to make a beautiful layout for your plug-in posts, especially mcbbs. The same plug-in can be up to 5-6 emeralds because of the post typesetting.
Go to Baidu to learn about BBCode, which is very useful. Remember, a good typography is very important!
### 2. Add some irrelevant functions
The more plug-in functions, the better, and in fact, it is very simple to extend the functions of your plug-in. Let me give you an example, such as the real-time cps plug-in. Obviously, it can only display too few cps functions. It is completely possible to add a player record with high cps, cps ranking, etc., which will make the plug-in a lot of color
### 3. Package your js plugin as a jar
mcbbs has a much higher affinity for jar than js, [one-click packaging](http://tools.blocklynukkit.com/jar.html)
### 4. Many pictures! Multi-map!
The importance is self-evident
### 5. Actively mining plug-in applicable scenarios
Write out the usage scenarios of your plug-in and put it in the post with pictures. As long as you count the above, the review will consider your plug-in to be very valuable
### 6. Appropriate "false publicity"
Write down some of the advantages that are not entirely your plug-in, such as high performance based on bn driver, extremely fast customization, high concurrency, fast configuration, etc.
### 7. Grasp the pain point
Think about how difficult it was to be without this plug-in when you opened the server, and play it up/funny
